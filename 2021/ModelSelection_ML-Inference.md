### INTRO:

Currently, two divergent systematic methods are commonly applied for inferring species trees: the supermatrix approach (concatenation) and the coalescent approach (gene trees are calculated and then reconciled in a species tree). You will find a couple of interesting papers on the topic at the end of this tutorial, but here we will focus on the supermatrix approach.

Before starting you should have all aligned & filtered MSA, or if you missed the previous lesson you can grab them from [here](https://github.com/for-giobbe/phy/blob/master/2021/Analyses/Precomputed_1-to-1_Alignments.tar.gz)
