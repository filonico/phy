## Working directory

The master directory for this year is the "2021". So clone the entire git repo and move into the correct folder. If you don't want other stuff on your computer you should locally remove anything else beside the working dir.

```
git clone https://github.com/for-giobbe/phy
cd ./2021
```

All code of the markdown files should be lunched in the master directory, otherwise change the paths where necessary.
Extract all necessary files:


```
cd Data/
```

Structure of the working directory:

## Dataset

In these lessons we are going to use the proteoms from 7 Mollusk species taken from public database plus one Anellidae as outgroup:

  * *Biomphalaria glabrata* (Gasteropoda)
  * *Acanthopleura granulata* (Poliplacophora)
  * *Crassostrea virginica* (Bivalvia)
  * *Lotita gigantea* (Gasteropoda)
  * *Octopus bimaculoides* (Cephalopoda)
  * *Sinivicula constricta* (Bivalvia)
  * *Pinctada fucata* (Bivalvia)
  * *Helobdella robusta* (Anellidae)

Let's have a look at the first ten headers of one of the proteoms (all are stored in the ```Data/Proteoms``` folder):

```
grep ">" Data/Proteoms/B_glabrata.pep | head -n 10
```
