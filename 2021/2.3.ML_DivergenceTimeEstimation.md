## Estimate divergence time in a Maximum Likelihood framework

Traditionally, divergence time estimation was performed through **Bayesian analyses** (*e.g* Beast) and this is still the common and prefered practice when analyzing from few to a moderant amount of loci. However nowadays, the large amount avaible data from NGS project has made the use of software based on maximum likelihood more and more frequent, especially when the divergence time estimation is not the main goal of the research (in that case Beast is still more used). Bayesian analyses is indeed able to naturally take into account and display a lot of different sources of uncertainty, from model selection (actually it is not a model selection but a  **model averanging**), to topology and obviously divergence time. Moreover Bayesian inference has the great advantage (but also disadvantage) to be able to incorporate prior in the form of probability distributions (we will see a lit bit more in the next step). However, it is also a double edge sword, since the long computational time this type of analysis requires.

As previusly said ML can overcome this issues and, as almost everything, IQ-TREE is able to do also this! Indedd it implements the least square dating (LSD2) method to build a time tree when you have date information for tips or ancestral nodes ([here](https://academic.oup.com/sysbio/article/65/1/82/2461506) the link for the original paper).

This are the mains functions provided by IQ-TREE:
