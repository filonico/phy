# Ortholgy inference

When setting up a phylogenetic project, the first necessary step is identify **ortologs genes..**

### What are orthologs and paralogs genes?

  * Orthologs are commonly defined as pairs of genes that started diverging after **speciations** events.  
  * Paragols genes, on contrary, started diverging after **duplication** events.  
 
### Why in phylogenetics inference we are interested in strictly orhologs genes?

*"Phylogenies require orthologous, not paralogous genes"* [Walter M. Fitch](https://academic.oup.com/sysbio/article-abstract/19/2/99/1655771).  

By definition, since orthologs genes arise by speciation events, they share the same evolutionary history of the underlying species. Moreover, beside phylogentics, orthologs genes should share the same **biological function**, while paralgos genes are belivied to differ in function (‘ortholog conjecture’ [Nehrt et al., 2011](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002073)).

However, as usual in biology, be aware of this latest corollary, recently ortholog conjecture has been largely questioned (see [Stamboulian et al., 2020](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/36/Supplement_1/i219/5870499) and [Lynch and Conery, 2000](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/290/5494/1151.abstract?casa_token=xqdhpSn423QAAAAA:mi5ecKfOTYeHPuelYUEP0zBd7gM-fEVWJDjZktvNo-bfFX5XjY44ns7epbpUHi9DmqzPv7id9Km2jA), [Gout and Lynch, 2015](https://academic.oup.com/mbe/article/32/8/2141/2925587?login=true) for for some interesting hints on fate of duplicated genes )

**Just to make things more complex...**

### Classification of ortologs and paralogs

Orthology is **always** defined by phylogenetics and unit of comparison:

 1. **One-to-one ortologs:** in both species is present only one copy of the gene, arise after speciation event.
 2. **Many-to-one** and **one-to-many ortologs:** after specieation event, one or more duplication events occured in one of the two lineages, as a result we have **three or more** ortholog genes!
 3. **Many-to-many ortologs:** after speciation event, one or more duplications events occured in both lineages, as a result we have **multiple copies** of ortologs genes.
 4. **In-paralogs:** is definied over a triplet. It involves a pair of genes and a speciation event of reference. A gene pair is an in-paralog if they are paralogs and duplicated after the speciation event of reference.
 5. **Out-paralogs:** is also a relation defined over a pair of genes and a speciation event of reference. This pair is out-paralogs if the duplication event through which they are related to each other predates the speciation event of reference.
