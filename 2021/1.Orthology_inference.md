## Ortholgy inference

#### What are orthologs and paralogs genes?

  * Orthologs are commonly defined as pairs of genes that started diverging after **speciations** events.  
  * Paragols genes, on contrary, started diverging after **duplication** events.  
 
#### Why in phylogenetics inference we are interested in strictly orhologs genes?

*"Phylogenies require orthologous, not paralogous genes"* [Walter M. Fitch](https://academic.oup.com/sysbio/article-abstract/19/2/99/1655771)
