## Ortholgy inference

#### What are orthologs and paralogs genes?

  * Orthologs are commonly defined as pairs of genes that started diverging after **speciations** events.  
  * Paragols genes, on contrary, started diverging after **duplication** events.  
 
#### Why in phylogenetics inference we are interested in strictly orhologs genes?

*"Phylogenies require orthologous, not paralogous genes"* [Walter M. Fitch](https://academic.oup.com/sysbio/article-abstract/19/2/99/1655771)
By definition, since orthologs genes arise by speciation events, they share the same evolutionary history of the underlying species. Moreover, beside phylogentics, orthologs genes should share the same **biological function**, while paralgos genes are belivied to differ in function (‘ortholog conjecture’ (Nehrt et al., 2011))[https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002073].

**NB** Be aware of this latest statment, recently ortholog conjecture has been largely questioned (see (Stamboulian et al., 2020)[https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/36/Supplement_1/i219/5870499] and )
